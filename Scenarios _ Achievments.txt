What are the Challenges you faced !


1. Pipeline is not working 
===========================
One of the application developer wants to promote the code to Pre-prod environment, 
unfornately pipeline is not working 

ans1: when I started  verifying the issue I came to know that what  
ever the jenkins slave node where this is gettting executed  
that node is having some issue with storage ..
 
ans2: when I started looking to the issue there is a problem with code 
checkout where slave node is facing connectivity issues with git 
and its unable to clone the code 

ans3: when ever the build job is getting executed its failing at a particular 
step which it need some dependend packages from the other build job which its 
not avaialble hence this build job is failing. 

2. Ansible playbook is not working 
===================================

ans1: When I have executed the playbook there are 200 servers on which we 
need to deploy our application configuration.  
unfortunately its getting failed to execute the code on all these servers. 
when I started debugging the code there is one task which making other tasks 
to fail, hence i used  ignore_error: true for that particular task and ran the code. 

3. Server  is not coming up 
============================

ans1: one of our collegue delete root filesystem. We have configured 
proper snapshots for the machines 
immediately i took the latest snapshot & brought the server back 

4. Loadbalancer is not connecting or instances are showing unhealthy
=====================================================================
ans1: there is one issue raised by application teams saying that application 
is not working, when i went and verified the configuration i came to know 
that all the instances under the LB are showing as unhealthy
I immediately logged in to the servers and I verified my application status 
locally in the server and I found "that the application is not coming up because 
of code failures, hence I informed developer to correct the code"
OR

"that the application port which is allocated for that application is
wrongly consumed by some other service in the servers. 
when I verified the port status using my netstat -nap|grep :portname;
ps -ef|grep -i processid I came to know that this port is  
consumed by some other application hence this application is not coming up "

OR

"that the application port is not allowed under the respective security group "

OR

"that the application port is gettting blocked by firewalls internal to the server"

5. Docker service is not coming up  && 6. Docker storage is full
=================================================================

ans: what ever the storage allocated for the docker deamon is consumed and unfornately 
there is not proper monitoring configured hence I took this as initiative and I created 
a script which will automatically runs every 1 hour and check the filesystem size if it 
feels that the size is more then it will purge all the unused images and it will clean the space. 

It also send me one email notification to my mailid once its done with housekeeping. 
I felt like shell is the best guy to do this work hence i automated this end-to-end 
workflow using shell scripting 

7. Eks/K8S cluster is not coming up 
====================================
when i verfied the cluster I found that all the control pane objects like 
apiserver,etcd,scheduler,controller are not coming up
Static Pods: what ever the services we are running as normal pods 
which are controlled by my kubelet 

ans: when ever I verified that the cluster is not responding to the 
kubectl commands, I came to know that there is issue with  my kubelet service & 
I figured it out like the StaticPod path is wrongly configured for the kubelet 
service. Hence all my  core components are not coming up which made my cluster to go down.

8. Deployments are failing 
==========================

'ImgPullErr': when I verified my deployment there is some problem with pull secret 
or Image is wrongly given
Volumeissue: when my deployment is trying to come up it is depending on the volume 
which is not configured properly as part of deployment configuration I remodified it, 
then its started working properly

9. pod's are not coming up
=========================== 
when i verified this issue I came know that my worker nodes are under high pressure 
and all the pods started evicting from one node to other node. 
When I dig the issue more I came to know that 2/3 workers nodes are down 
because of network issues.

in order to solve this problem I immediately changed the nodeselector value of my 
production namespaces & i bound the deployments to a stable node so that we are 
not going to face the downtime for the application

10. production deployment failure
=================================
we released a new version for our application where we configured rolling deployment 
for the services. Everything went well and application was working as expected, unfornately 
after 6 hours we started facing issue with the application performance.
 
Its a critical application where customers started escalating the issue, 
so immediately they want to revert back the changes to the previous version

I have a habbit of deploying the services using "--record" option where 
I can track it out what are and all the changes  are happening on the deployment. 
I immediately verified my deployment rollout history using 
"kubectl rollout history deploy deployment" and I found that my previous version update 
is recorded properly 
then I simply rollout the previous version for my application & everything 
started working in minutes. Hence I saved downtime.

11. one of the production application is down
============================================== 

ans1: there is one issue raised by application teams saying that application 
is not working, when i went and verified the configuration i came to know that 
all the instances under the LB are showing as unhealthy
I immediately logged in to the servers and 
I verified my application status locally in the server and 
I found
"that the application is not coming up because of code failures, 
hence I informed developer to correct the code"

OR

"that the application port which is allocated for that application is wrongly consumed by some other service in the servers when I verified the port status using my netstat -nap|grep :portname;ps -ef|grep -i processid I came to know that this port is  consumed by some other application hence this application is not coming up "
OR
"that the application port is not allowed under the respective security group "
OR
"that the application port is gettting blocked by firewalls internal to the server"


Best achievements in the project ::
==================================
1. CICD implementation for legacy application  && Succesfully implemented IaC for the java based applications
============================================================================================================== 
when i recently to this project everything is happening manully I took this as initiative for  automation
one of the best part which i did as part of my current organization/team/application is, there was one legacy java application which people are deploying the code manully in all the environments like dev,sit,uat,pt,pre-prod,prod and we are having different servers (linux) for different environments where everything like package installation & configuration is happening manually. 

I felt like its not the right way of working hence I started introducing IAC i.e my ansible. 
I started converting conventional manual work in to my playbooks. As part of testing I took one server and i have configured  everything in that server using my ansible code. 

I slowly started removing the old servers from the environment starting from  dev till production & kept my newly configured nodes as part of the project. 

Not only this but also I have designed & developed my end to end CICD process for my entire Java based application where I same almost 3 days of manual deployment process to 10  minutes of automated deployment process. 

2. Implementation of microservices for the legacy application 
==============================================================
As part of digitilization our company is planning to migrate the legacy 
or monolithic applications to microservices. I took  this oppurtunity 
and i started collecting different information from diff application developers 
like platform needs such as softwares (java,node,maven,tomcat,apache,nginx,centos,redhat) 
and I started customizing the docker images for all these  applications. 

we felt that K8S will satisfy our needs hence I installed & configured my k8s cluster. 
I started with small java based application and I succefully migrated my monolithic service 
in to microservices architecutre  & Gave demo to my team everyone felt happy  
and I got appreciation mail for my work.

3. Reducing the deployment time to market && 4. Succesfully automated end to end CICD 
implementation for the java application CICD Process for your application delivery 

6. There is some important fix which we need to deploy for all our servers 
as part of security concern.
I took this as initiative and started developing the code with my Ansible, 
this will pick the servers where 
the version for the package and if the version of the package  is 
<required package version then it will remove the old version and it will install the new version in all the servers. 
As a result of my work I got good appreciation mail from my 
lead as it save almost 20 days of manual work which my code  did it in 2 hours ..


Scenario Oriented Questions:

ques: One of the application is desgined with proper CICD and its going to the production 
unfornately during the production release time Jenkins is down !!!

Ans : I don't have time to fix the issue as its bussiness critical application which is going live
good part in this is I have automated this end to end delivery & deployment using my ansible code. 

Since my jenkins is down, I immediately logined to my workstation & started executing my playbooks for my CI & CD manully from the server. This saved my time for releasing the product to the market. 

( Always looks for alternative workarounds to save time)
