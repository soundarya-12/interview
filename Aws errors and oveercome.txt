AWS

Frontend: Angular hosted on Amazon S3 with CloudFront for global CDN.
Backend: Node.js API running on Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service).
Database: Amazon RDS (MySQL) for relational data.
Authentication: Amazon Cognito for user authentication.
Monitoring: CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
CI/CD: Pipeline built using CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the backend service.
Domain Management: Route 53 for DNS routing.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Infrastructure Setup (IaC using Terraform)
Provision the infrastructure using Terraform for consistency and repeatability.

Example Terraform Configuration:

hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "frontend_bucket" {
  bucket = "ecommerce-frontend-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"
}

resource "aws_rds_instance" "ecommerce_db" {
  allocated_storage    = 20
  engine               = "mysql"
  engine_version       = "8.0"
  instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
  name                 = "ecommerce"
  username             = "admin"
  password             = "password123"
  publicly_accessible  = false
}
2. Application Development
Frontend: Angular app built with REST API calls to the backend.
Backend: Node.js API connected to the RDS database for product and order management.
Dockerize the Backend:
dockerfile
Copy code
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline
Source: Use GitHub as the source repository.
Build: Use AWS CodeBuild to build and test the application.
Deploy:
Frontend: Deploy to S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache.
Backend: Deploy to ECS using CodeDeploy.
CodePipeline Configuration (JSON):

      }
    ]
  }
}

 Deploy the Frontend to S3
Angular Build:

bash
Copy code
ng build --prod
aws s3 sync ./dist/ecommerce-app s3://ecommerce-frontend-bucket
Set CloudFront Distribution:

Configure an origin pointing to the S3 bucket.
Enable cache invalidation after deployment.
5. Backend Deployment to ECS
Create a Fargate Task Definition for the Node.js backend container.
Configure an ECS Cluster and deploy using the task definition.
Attach the ALB to route traffic to ECS services.

Database Setup
Use Amazon RDS for relational database requirements.
Connect the backend to the RDS instance using environment variables.
Node.js Configuration (example):

javascript
Copy code
const mysql = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME
});
7. Monitoring and Logging
Enable CloudWatch Logs for ECS tasks to monitor backend logs.
Set up Alarms for:
High CPU or memory utilization.
Unhealthy targets in the ALB.

Expected Artifacts
Deployed Frontend: Angular application accessible via CloudFront URL.
Deployed Backend: API hosted on ECS accessible through ALB.
Database Instance: RDS MySQL instance for data storage.
Pipeline Logs: Build, test, and deployment logs in CodePipeline.
Docker Image: Stored in Amazon ECR for backend services.
CloudWatch Logs: Capturing backend logs and error reports.

Common Errors in AWS Projects and How to Overcome Them
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common errors faced during AWS-based project development 
and deployment, along with solutions:

Access Denied Errors
Error:
Receiving Access Denied when trying to interact with services like S3, RDS, or other AWS resources.
Cause:
Insufficient permissions in the IAM policy attached to the user or role.
Solution:
Check IAM Policy:

Ensure the IAM user/role has the necessary permissions for the operation.
json
Copy code
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}
Attach Correct Policies:

Use AWS managed policies or create custom policies with least privilege.
Validate Role Assumptions:

If using a role, 
verify the entity can assume the role (e.g., AssumeRolePolicy).

 EC2 Instance Termination
Error:
An EC2 instance is terminated unexpectedly or deleted.
Cause:
Auto-scaling configuration might be misconfigured.
Instance termination protection is not enabled.
Solution:
Enable Termination Protection:

Modify the instance settings:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef --no-disable-api-termination
Inspect Auto-Scaling Policies:

Review scaling triggers and adjust thresholds to prevent unnecessary terminations.
Backup Data:

Use EBS snapshots or AMIs to ensure data recovery if the instance is lost.

Lambda Function Failing
Error:
Lambda function fails with timeout, permission, or missing dependency errors.
Cause:
Execution timeout exceeds the limit.
Insufficient permissions for resources like S3, DynamoDB, etc.
Missing dependencies in the Lambda package.
Solution:
Increase Timeout:
Configure timeout in the Lambda settings.
Update IAM Role:
Ensure the Lambda execution role includes required permissions.
Package Dependencies:
Package and include dependencies locally or via Lambda layers.
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt -t .
zip -r function.zip .

RDS Connection Issues
Error:
Backend fails to connect to the RDS database.
Cause:
Security group configuration blocks access.
Incorrect database credentials or endpoint.
Solution:
Verify Security Group:
Allow inbound traffic on the correct port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).
Check Endpoint:
Ensure the correct endpoint is being used in the application.
Test Connectivity:
Use telnet or nc to verify connectivity from the source environment.
bash
Copy code
telnet mydb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 3306

S3 Bucket Access Issues
Error:
Files cannot be uploaded or accessed from an S3 bucket.
Cause:
Misconfigured bucket policies.
Lack of public access when required.
Solution:
Check Bucket Policy:
Add appropriate policies for access:
json
Copy code
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}
Enable Public Access (if needed):
Adjust settings to allow public read for static websites.
Use Signed URLs:
Generate pre-signed URLs for controlled access.

ECR Authentication Issues
Error:
Docker push or pull fails with authentication errors.
Cause:
The authentication token for ECR has expired or was not generated.
Solution:
Authenticate with AWS CLI:
bash
Copy code
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_REPO_URL>
Use IAM Role on EC2:
Attach an IAM role with ECR permissions to the EC2 instance.

 ECS Service Not Scaling
Error:
ECS tasks are not scaling as expected under load.
Cause:
Auto-scaling policies are not configured or thresholds are incorrect.
Solution:
Check Scaling Policies:
Ensure policies are defined for CPU or memory usage thresholds.
json
Copy code
{
  "ResourceId": "service/cluster-name/service-name",
  "ScalableDimension": "ecs:service:DesiredCount",
  "MinCapacity": 1,
  "MaxCapacity": 10
}
Validate CloudWatch Alarms:
Verify alarms triggering the scaling actions.

Kubernetes Pod Issues
Error:
One or more pods in the Kubernetes cluster are not running.
Cause:
Insufficient resources, configuration errors, or failed health checks.
Solution:
Check Pod Status:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
Inspect Logs:
bash
Copy code
kubectl logs <pod-name>
Describe Pod:
Look for detailed error messages:
bash
Copy code
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Adjust Resource Limits:
Update CPU and memory limits in the deployment manifest.

Route 53 DNS Resolution Issues
Error:
Custom domain does not resolve to the application.
Cause:
Incorrect DNS records or propagation delays.
Solution:
Verify DNS Records:
Ensure A, CNAME, or Alias records point to the correct resource (e.g., ALB).
Test Resolution:
bash
Copy code
nslookup example.com
Wait for Propagation:
DNS changes may take up to 24-48 hours to propagate.

Cost Overruns
Error:
Unexpectedly high costs for AWS resources.
Cause:
Unused resources like idle EC2 instances or unoptimized storage.
Solution:
Set Budgets:
Use AWS Budgets to monitor spending.
Analyze Costs:
Use AWS Cost Explorer for insights.
Optimize Resources:
Shut down unused EC2 instances and delete unused EBS volumes.
