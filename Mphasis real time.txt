What are the major advantage of terraform and when would you prefer that
Major Advantages of Terraform
Cloud Agnostic (Multi-Cloud Support):
Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, VMware, and many others via providers.
Great for hybrid or multi-cloud strategies.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
You define infrastructure in human-readable HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).
Version-controlled using Git for traceability and collaboration.
Declarative Approach:
You declare what you want (desired state), and Terraform figures out how to achieve it.
Easier to manage than imperative scripts.
Execution Plans (terraform plan):
Shows exactly what changes will happen before applying them — minimizes risk.

State Management:
Maintains a state file to track resources — allows comparison between real and desired state.
Enables drift detection and incremental changes.

Modular & Reusable Code:
Supports modules for reusable and composable infrastructure components (like VPCs, databases, etc.).

Community and Ecosystem:
Large collection of official and third-party providers.
Modules available via Terraform Registry.

Automation Friendly:
Easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
API available for advanced automation.

Immutable Infrastructure:
Encourages recreation of resources instead of modifying in-place, which reduces config drift.
 When to Prefer Terraform
You should prefer Terraform when:
✅ You manage multi-cloud or hybrid environments.
✅ You want repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure deployments.
✅ You are using CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure automation.
✅ You want predictable deployments using execution plans.
✅ You need to build and share reusable infrastructure modules across teams.
✅ You want to track state changes and detect configuration drift over time.
✅ You are orchestrating complex systems like Kubernetes, EKS, RDS, VPC, etc.

5. Secrets Management
HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
Injected at runtime via Kubernetes secrets or CSI driver

6. Monitoring & Logging
Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
ELK/EFK Stack or CloudWatch Logs

Developer -> Git Push -> Webhook -> Jenkins CI
     -> Lint/Test/Scan -> Docker Build -> ECR
     -> Helm Chart Update -> GitOps (ArgoCD) 
     -> Kubernetes Deployment
     -> Monitoring + Rollback (if needed)
🚀 Scalability Strategies
Use managed Kubernetes (EKS) with autoscaling nodes
Setup horizontal pod autoscalers (HPA) for microservices
Split large pipelines with parallel stages
Use caching and artifact storage to reduce build time
Setup multi-cluster strategy (prod, staging) via ArgoCD projects

🔐 Security Best Practices
IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) in EKS
Pipeline-level secrets masking
Audit logging for deployments (AWS CloudTrail)
Image allowlisting using policy engines (OPA/Gatekeeper)
Secure networking (Private subnets, security groups)

🔁 Example Scenario
Deployment of a New Payment Microservice:
Dev pushes code to develop
Jenkins triggers CI pipeline: runs tests → builds Docker image → scans → pushes to ECR
Helm chart version updated in Git
ArgoCD detects Git change → syncs to EKS staging
QA signs off; PR merged to main
ArgoCD promotes to prod with a canary rollout
Metrics monitored via Prometheus; if latency ↑ → auto rollback triggered

What your approach for to setting up the observability for new infrastructure for new micro service in production?What logs and metrics

1. Instrumentation First
Before deployment, ensure the microservice is instrumented with:
Structured logging (JSON format recommended)
Metrics (business + system)
Tracing (distributed tracing where applicable)
Use libraries/tools like:
OpenTelemetry
Prometheus client libraries
Language-specific loggers (e.g., winston for Node.js, logrus for Go)

🔹 2. Logging Setup
Capture logs at different levels:
Application logs (errors, warnings, info, debug)
System logs (Kubernetes pod events, OS-level logs)
Access logs (from Nginx/ALB/API Gateway)
Tools:
Log Aggregator: Fluent Bit, Fluentd, or Logstash
Log Storage & Search: Elasticsearch, AWS OpenSearch, or Loki
Visualization: Kibana or Grafana Loki
✅ Enable log correlation IDs (request ID, user ID, trace ID) for traceability across services.
🔹 3. Metrics Setup
Capture the following:

Infrastructure Metrics
CPU, memory, disk I/O (per node/pod)
Network usage (Kubernetes service/pod)
Load balancer traffic (4xx/5xx rates)

Application Metrics
Request rate (RPS)
Request latency (avg, p95, p99)
Error rate
Custom business metrics (e.g., payment success count)

Database Metrics
Query execution time
Connection pool usage
Slow queries
Tools:
Prometheus: Metric collection
Grafana: Dashboarding
Alertmanager: Alerting (via Slack, email, PagerDuty)

🔹 4. Tracing Setup
Use Distributed Tracing if the service interacts with others.
Tools:
OpenTelemetry + Jaeger / Tempo
Trace headers propagated across services
Visualize latency bottlenecks per service-hop
🔹 5. Alerting & SLOs
Define SLOs: e.g., 99.9% availability, p95 latency < 200ms
Create alerts based on:
High error rates (e.g., 5xx > 1%)
High response times (e.g., p99 > 500ms)
Pod restart spikes
Saturated resources (CPU > 90% for X mins)
Tools:
Grafana Alerting / Prometheus Alertmanager
Integration with Slack, Opsgenie, PagerDuty

Can you tel us the major real time or high level infrastructure resolving what caused it and how you resolved it
Incident: High Latency & 5xx Errors in Production (EKS-Based Microservices Platform)
🧠 Context
SaaS product deployed on AWS EKS.
Microservices communicate via REST APIs through an internal Istio service mesh.
Ingress: AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
CI/CD via Jenkins + ArgoCD.
Logs & Metrics via Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK.
Issue
Users started reporting timeouts and slow responses. Alertmanager triggered warnings:
p95 latency > 4s
Spike in 502/504 gateway errors
API Gateway metrics showed request surge
Initial Investigation
Grafana dashboards showed:
CPU/memory on all pods were normal.
Latency spike correlated with a spike in RPS.
Istio metrics showed high upstream response time from one critical service: auth-service.

ELK logs:
auth-service pods were logging DBConnectionTimeoutException.
DB monitoring (RDS MySQL):
Connection count was hitting max connections.
Slow queries appeared in the audit log.

🧬 Root Cause
A recent code deployment introduced a new feature in auth-service.
The feature triggered N+1 database queries due to a misused ORM relationship.
Under high traffic, each request spawned multiple DB connections.
RDS connection pool maxed out, causing timeouts.
Retry logic at the service layer caused cascading retries, further increasing load.
🛠️ Resolution Steps
Immediate Mitigation:
Scaled up auth-service and RDS read replicas temporarily.
Updated retry policy (circuit breaker in Istio) to back off faster.
Rollback:
Rolled back the last Helm deployment using ArgoCD to the previous stable commit.
Permanent Fix:
Optimized the ORM query to use joins instead of lazy-loading.
Set DB connection pool size explicitly in the app config.
Added query limits and batching.
Postmortem Improvements:
Enabled slow query logging alert thresholds.
Instrumented the service with Prometheus metrics for query count per request.
Added an automated rollback policy if latency and error rate cross thresholds during deploy.
✅ Outcome
Latency dropped from ~4s back to <300ms.
DB load stabilized after connection pooling and query optimization.
Deployment process now includes synthetic traffic simulation for DB-heavy flows.

How would you document the infrastructure setup and maintainability and everyone must understand wt I am doing
1. Use a Standard Structure

Confluence / Notion	Better for collaboration and structure
Diagrams.net / Lucidchart	Drawing architecture visuals
Terraform Docs Generator	Auto-generate docs for modules (terraform-docs)
MkDocs / Docusaurus	For internal developer portals or static documentation sites

💡 4. Best Practices
Keep it live: Update after every major change. Treat it like code.
Use diagrams: People understand visual more quickly.
Link to real resources: Repos, dashboards, Terraform module paths, etc.
Make it searchable: Especially for large teams (tags, folders, keywords).
Add a glossary: To explain terms like VPC, IRSA, GitOps, etc.
Provide quickstart docs: “How to deploy a new service”, “How to rollback”, etc.

🧪 5. Make It Accessible & Shared
Store documentation in GitHub/GitLab Wiki, Confluence, or a shared Notion workspace.
Link documentation in:
Onboarding guides

🧭 Example: Infrastructure Overview Snippet (Markdown)

## Infrastructure Overview
This project is deployed on AWS using Terraform as IaC. The architecture includes:
- **VPC**: 3-tier network with public and private subnets.
- **EKS**: Kubernetes cluster with HPA and node groups.
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Managed DB with daily backups.
- **S3**: Used for storing artifacts and static assets.
All services are provisioned via `terraform apply` and managed via ArgoCD for GitOps deployment.

What your approach during the safe deployment during high rish changes calling services
Approach for Safe Deployment of High-Risk Changes
🔹 1. Pre-Deployment Planning
a. Impact Assessment
Identify what services the change will affect (downstream/upstream).
Review blast radius: Will this affect users, APIs, internal tools?
Ensure the change is backward-compatible (especially for APIs).
b. Peer Review & Approvals
PR must be reviewed by senior engineers or system owners.
Security and compliance review if the change touches auth/data.
c. Runbooks & Rollback Plan
Document step-by-step deployment and rollback instructions.
Include health checks, logs to monitor, and rollback command.
d. Staging Validation
Deploy to staging with synthetic traffic or shadow traffic.
Compare metrics (latency, error rate, CPU/mem, etc.) with baseline.
🔹 2. Deployment Strategies for Safety
Strategy	When to Use	Tools
Canary Deployments	Roll out to small % of users/nodes first	ArgoCD, Flagger, Spinnaker
Blue/Green	Full switch between environments	Kubernetes, Load Balancer
Feature Flags	Toggle risky code paths at runtime	LaunchDarkly, Unleash
Shadow Deployments	Run new version in parallel for testing	Envoy, Istio, custom proxy
Example: For a breaking change in auth-service, use:
Canary rollout to 10% of traffic using Istio route weight
Monitor key metrics for 10 minutes
Gradually increase traffic if healthy

🔹 3. Monitoring During Deployment
Real-time dashboards: p95/p99 latency, 5xx errors, pod restarts
Logs streaming: Filter by deployment revision or trace ID
Distributed tracing: Confirm upstream/downstream calls are successful
Use:
Prometheus + Grafana
ELK / Loki
Jaeger / OpenTelemetry
Set up automated alerts:
Error rate > 2% (trigger alert)
Latency p95 > 500ms
Deployment fails readiness probes

🔹 4. Progressive Rollout & Observability
Argo Rollouts / Flagger for Kubernetes-based canary
Use metrics-based analysis to promote or rollback
Pause deployment if alerts trigger
Use dashboards tagged with deployment version (env, build_id, etc.)

🔹 5. Post-Deployment Verification
Smoke test key endpoints manually or via Postman/Newman
Run integration tests against the deployed service
Watch for delayed failures (e.g., DB issues, message queues)

🔙 6. Rollback Plan
Keep last known good image tagged and tested
If deploying via Helm or ArgoCD, roll back with helm rollback or Git revert
Rollback infrastructure changes via Terraform with plan → apply (if needed)
Disable feature flag or scale down new deployment if it’s partial
🚨 Real-Life Example
Change: Upgrading payment-service to support multiple currencies
Risk: Affects all downstream billing services + customer experience
Approach:
Add feature behind flag: multi_currency_enabled
Deploy behind canary (10% traffic)
Run integration tests and live monitoring
Gradual increase to 25%, 50%, 100% if healthy
Enable flag globally after rollout
Rollback ready in case currency conversion errors spike

How you test nd validate the code infrastructure code changes before applying the code changes
Approach to Test & Validate Infrastructure Code Changes
🧪 1. Static Code Analysis & Linting
Use linters and formatters to catch syntax errors and enforce best practices:
Tool	IaC Type	Purpose
terraform fmt	Terraform	Auto-format code for consistency
tflint	Terraform	Lint for syntax and AWS/GCP usage checks
checkov / tfsec	Terraform	Security & misconfiguration detection
ansible-lint	Ansible	Enforce Ansible best practices
kubeval, helm lint	Kubernetes/Helm	Validate manifests & templates

🧱 2. Pre-Plan Checks (Dry Run)
✅ Terraform

terraform init      # Initialize modules/providers
terraform validate  # Syntax validation
terraform plan      # Dry run - show proposed changes
Use -target to isolate specific modules during tests.

✅ Helm
helm lint ./mychart                 # Template syntax check
helm template ./mychart | kubeval  # Render and validate with Kubernetes schemas

🚧 3. Use Sandbox/Staging Environments
Before deploying to production:
Create non-prod (sandbox or staging) environments that mirror production
Apply infrastructure changes there
Run automated smoke tests or integration tests post-deployment
Use Terraform workspaces or isolated AWS accounts for safe testing.

🧪 4. Unit/Integration Tests for IaC
Tool	Description
Terratest (Go)	Run tests against real infrastructure, validate outputs, and teardown
Kitchen-Terraform	Run test cases similar to Test Kitchen
InSpec	Compliance tests for VMs, cloud resources
Testinfra (Python)	Validate server state after Ansible/Terraform run
Example (Terratest): Check if an S3 bucket was created and is versioned.

🔄 5. CI/CD Validation Pipeline
In Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab:
Run terraform validate, tflint, checkov
Run terraform plan and save output
Require manual approval before applying in production


# GitHub Actions Sample (Terraform)
- name: Terraform Format
  run: terraform fmt -check
- name: Terraform Validate
  run: terraform validate
- name: Terraform Plan
  run: terraform plan -out=tfplan

🧯 6. Peer Review with Plan Output
Commit plan output to a PR comment
Review the diff of resources:

Will it destroy anything?
Are tags, names, and values correct?
Are you unintentionally affecting production?

👀 7. Observability in Testing
Monitor metrics/logs from test environment
Use synthetic tests or scripts to validate:
EC2 is reachable
ALB is healthy
DB is responding
DNS resolves

📦 8. Use -auto-approve only in Lower Envs
In production:
Never use terraform apply -auto-approve
Prefer manual apply with review
Backup the current state before applying
