explain your current CI/CD setup?
CI/CD tooling 
what are the tools you are using?
what is CI/CD accordig to you
how CI/CD is established in your organisation

jenkins.
in the current organization we use github as a source repository.
we are using jenkins for continous integregration where we have set-up webhook
which triggers that each and every commit that is made to github and triggers a ci pipeline on jenkins

1.build stage- takes cares of ststic code analysis,unit testing and build
2.test stage- running smoke and functional tests
3.deploy stage- push artifacts to the registry,prepare deployment manifasts and deploy on the cluster

what is your stage in jenkins
what is your artifactory?how you are building your docker image or application arcive
how you are deploying on to your kubernetes cluster or weblogic application service server


Static Code Analysis: We use tools like SonarQube or Checkstyle for code quality checks.
Unit Testing: We use frameworks like JUnit (for Java), PyTest (for Python), or Go’s testing framework depending on the language.

we use a Dockerfile to build the Docker image in this stage using the docker build command inside Jenkins

Test Stage:

 Execute tests (smoke, functional, or integration tests) to ensure quality before deployment.

Smoke Tests: Simple health check tests to verify basic functionality.

Automated Test Execution

Deploy Stage:
Objective: Push artifacts (Docker images or WAR/JAR files) to an artifact repository, generate deployment manifests (if necessary), and deploy to the Kubernetes cluster.

Artifact Repository: We use Artifactory or Nexus to store versioned Docker images, WAR/JAR files, or other build artifacts.

Deployment to Kubernetes: Deployment manifests (YAML) are prepared in this stage, and kubectl or Helm is used to deploy the application to a Kubernetes (EKS) cluster. We define Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret) or use Helm charts for complex deployments.

 Jfrog Artifactory-artifact repository to store and manage the build artifacts.

we build docker images using
dockerfile
jenkins pipleine- to build the docker image
pusing to artifactory

Kubernetes:

Manifest Files: We define Kubernetes deployment YAML files or use Helm charts. These files are often prepared during the CI pipeline to reflect the new Docker image tag.
kubectl/Helm Commands: Once the manifest is prepared, Jenkins executes kubectl apply -f or helm upgrade commands to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster (EKS in AWS).
Rolling Updates: Kubernetes ensures zero downtime by deploying with rolling updates, ensuring the old version is replaced gradually.
Monitoring: We set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor deployments and ensure everything is running smoothly.
WebLogic Application Server (if applicable):

WAR/JAR Files: For applications deployed on WebLogic, we generate the WAR/JAR files in Jenkins and push them to Nexus.
Deployment Tools: We use WLST (WebLogic Scripting Tool) or WebLogic’s Admin Console to deploy the WAR/JAR files to the WebLogic server, either automatically or with manual intervention depending on the environment.
Configuration Management: Configuration changes are handled via WebLogic domain settings, and Ansible can be used to automate configuration tasks.

how do you handle secrets
