To create a Python script that reads data from two Excel files, 
combines the data, and writes the combined output to a single Excel file 
with a bar chart, you can use the pandas library for data manipulation 
and openpyxl for chart creation. Here's an example:

Reading Data: The script reads two Excel files using pandas.read_excel().
Combining Data: It concatenates the data using pd.concat().
Writing Data: The combined DataFrame is written to an output 
Excel file with pandas.ExcelWriter (using the openpyxl engine).
Creating a Chart: A bar chart is added using openpyxl.chart.BarChart. 
The data and categories are referenced dynamically based on the size of the 
combined DataFrame.
Saving the File: The combined file is saved as combined_output.xlsx.

import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.chart import BarChart, Reference
from openpyxl.utils.dataframe import dataframe_to_rows

# Step 1: Read two Excel files
file1 = 'file1.xlsx'
file2 = 'file2.xlsx'

# Assuming both files have a sheet named 'Sheet1' with the same structure
df1 = pd.read_excel(file1, sheet_name='Sheet1')
df2 = pd.read_excel(file2, sheet_name='Sheet1')

# Step 2: Combine the data
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

# Step 3: Write combined data to a new Excel file
output_file = 'combined_output.xlsx'
with pd.ExcelWriter(output_file, engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    combined_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Data', index=False)
    
    # Get the workbook and worksheet to add a chart
    workbook = writer.book
    worksheet = writer.sheets['Data']

    # Step 4: Add a bar chart
    chart = BarChart()
    chart.title = "Combined Data Bar Chart"
    chart.style = 10  # Chart style
    chart.x_axis.title = 'Categories'
    chart.y_axis.title = 'Values'

    # Assuming the first column is categorical and the rest are numerical
    rows, cols = combined_df.shape
    data = Reference(worksheet, min_col=2, min_row=1, max_col=cols, max_row=rows + 1)
    categories = Reference(worksheet, min_col=1, min_row=2, max_row=rows + 1)

    chart.add_data(data, titles_from_data=True)
    chart.set_categories(categories)
    worksheet.add_chart(chart, "E5")

print(f"Combined data with a bar chart saved to {output_file}")
