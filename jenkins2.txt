jenkins
-------
jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration
and continuous delivery

it automates the process of building,testing and deploying software application,
allowing teams to deliver high-quality software faster

What is a Jenkins Pipeline?
a jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that allows teams to define their software 
delivery process as code.
it enables the creation of complex workflows,including build,test and deployment stages 
which can be version-controlled alongside application

how do you define jenkins pipeline

jenkins pipeline which is the text file written in groovy syntax

jenkinsfile describes the stages,steps and configuration of the pipeline,allowing for automated and repeatable
software delivery processes

Explain the difference between scripted and declarative Jenkins Pipelines
scripted pipeline
groovy syntax
flexibilty and power
more coding effort

scripted pipeline use a groovy-based scripting language
to define pipeline logic,providing more flexibility and power but requiring more coding effort

declarative pipeline use a simpler more structured syntax for defining pipelines,making them easier to read, write and
maintain

What is a Jenkins Agent (Node), and how does it work?
a jenkins agent also known as a node,is a machine (physical or virtual) that executes tasks as part of a jenkins build process
agents can run on the same machine as the jenkins server(master) or on remote machines
they communicate with the jenkins master to receive build instructions and report results

Explain the purpose of Jenkins plugins.
jenkins plugins extend the functionality of jenkins automation server by providing
plugins can be used to support varios tasks such as source code management,build tools,
testing frameworks, deployment platforms, and notification systems

how do you secure jenkins?
->jenkins can be secured by enabling authentication mechanism like
LDAP,active directory,or OAuth
->access control can be configured using role-based security which defines
permissions for users and groups
->jenkins connections can be encrypted using HTTPS, and security plugins can be installed to
enhance protection against vulerabilties

What is the Jenkinsfile and how is it used?
thevjenkinsfile is a text file written in groovy syntax that defines
the configuration of a jenkins pipeline.
it describes the stages,steps and post-build actions of the pipeline,
allowing teams to define their software delivery process as code and manage
it alongside applocation code in version control systems like git

Explain Jenkins build triggers and how they work.
jenkins build triggers are mechanisms that initiate a build job based on specific
events or conditions
triggers can be configured to start a build periodically
(eg cron schedule) when changes are pushed to a version control system(e.g git webhook)
or when other build jobs complete (e.g downstream/upstream dependencies)

How do you automate deployments using Jenkins?
->deployments can be automated using jenkins pipeline or freestyle projects
with appropriate build steps and post-build actions

jenkins can execute deployment scripts, interact with deployment tools and platform
(e.g kubernetes,docker,AWS) and trigger deployments based on pre-defined conditions or user inputs

What are Jenkins build artifacts, and how are they used?
jenkins build artifacts are files generated during the build process such as complied binaries,test results,
documentation and archives

artifacts are stored on the jenkins server or external artifact respositories and can be
accessed, archived,published or used in downstream jobs for further processing or deployment

Explain the concept of Jenkins pipeline stages.
jenkins pipelines stages represent distinct phases or steps in a software delivery process such as build,test,deploy and notify

each stage can contain one or more build steps,tests or actions and can be configured to run sequentially
in parallel, or conditionally based specific criteria

How do you troubleshoot Jenkins build failures?
jenkins build failures can be troubleshooted by reviewing build logs,console output and error
message

debugging techniques include enabling verbose logging,examing jenkins server and agent configuration,checking for resource contraints
verifying dependenies, and analyzing code changes that may have introduced errors
